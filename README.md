## Project 2

For this project, I was asked to analyze nightlife activity in NYC using spatial methods. I decided to focus on drinking patterns based on 311 complaints against public drunkenness and public urination as well as dive bar locations. 

I've included my data gathering, final paper, and slide deck here. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or ideas for further analysis.
